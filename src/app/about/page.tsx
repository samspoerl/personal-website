              Hi, my name is Sam Spoerl. I&apos;m a software engineer and I&apos;ve been
              writing code for over {getYearsExperience()} years.
            </p>

            <p>
              Like many software developers, I got my start because of some
              tedious task I didn&apos;t want to do anymore. For me, it was a report
              that required a lot of manual parsing through data in a home-grown
              ERP system. I then spent an entire summer learning SQL in my free
              time to automate that report.
            </p>

            <p>
              After that, I was forever changed. I discovered my love for
              automation and writing code. After college, I started my first job
              as a Supply Chain Analyst on a brand-new team. The team was
              effectively formed for a single initial purpose: to crank out
              reports.
            </p>

            <p>
              These reports were an immensely manual process. Our data source
              was filled with unclean data, where we needed to understand that
              “PRODUCT” and “prdct” were the same thing. We estimated that it
              took about 60 hours on average to finish a report for a single
              product.
            </p>

            <p>
              Driven by a dislike for manual processes, I learned Python to fill
              the gaps that SQL left in the process. Combining multiple queries
              with a fuzzy-wuzzy string match and pandas DataFrames, I was able
              to reduce the man hours to complete this task down to as little as
              a minute. We still had to wait for the program to run, but we were
              able to work on other, more fulfilling tasks while we waited.
            </p>

            <p>
              That began my love affair with coding. Since then, I&apos;ve explored
              myriad other languages and frameworks, including JavaScript,
              TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Java, and C#. Recently, I&apos;ve worked mostly
              with .NET for work and Next.js for my personal projects.
            </p>

            {/* <p>
              I don&apos;t have a favorite of the two, and I&apos;d say the choice depends
              on what I&apos;m building. My company is thorougly integrated into the
              Microsoft ecosystem, so everything we do is .NET. I think Next.js
              is a fantastic front-end framework, and in my experience, Python
              and Node have better third-party support. For example, OpenAI
              and Plaid, which provide APIs that two of my personal projects
              consume, have SDKs for Python and Node, but not .NET.
            </p> */}

            <p>
              Also, I began focusing in areas such as cloud services, Agile
              methodology, DevOps, and database management. As a member of a
              small software development team, I&apos;ve had my hand in everything.
              No language, framework, or technology is off limits. This has not
              only satisfied my intellectual itch, but made me an all-around
              better engineer.
            </p>

            <p>
              It&apos;s been an unconventional path, but a very rewarding one. I feel
              like I&apos;ve had to work twice as hard as other developers to catch
              up and prove myself. The only reason it&apos;s been possible is because
              I absolutely love it. I find coding addicting. I love solving
              problems and coding is one big, never-ending problem. Building an
              app, a feature, or learning a new skill feels like completing a
              level in Super Mario Bros. I get a little hit of dopamine with
              every commit.
